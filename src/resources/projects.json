    "description":"EventLite, formerly known as Evaquint, is an application I co-founded with the purpose of addressing a major event organization problem I found apparent in my local community. EventLite tackles event organization by providing a platform for participants and hosts to interact over a simplified event-planning process. JWT tokens were implemented to validate users and create a robust user management system through Postgres SQL. A service-oriented approach was selected in order to develop a RESTful API back-end that scales with growing numbers of users, events, and vendors. Adobe XD drafted wireframes/flows showcase design choices that focused on simplistic UI and great UX.",

A point to note is that SafeTag was created in limited time but was designed with the intention of expanding it’s usage to a number of real-world applications such as museum downsizing and tourism enabling (through an arts-agram of sorts).",
